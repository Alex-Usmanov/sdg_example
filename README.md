## Things considered out of scope
1. Navigation
2. Localization (hence no language headers for api for example, or localized strings)
3. UI: no design provided. strictly for functional purposes
4. UI breakpoints. lets assume phone only
5. Fancy linting rules. Useful in production, too long to set up here
6. Harcoded values: obviously base url should not be hardcoded in the code, nor should other things
7. Reliability: retries, metrics, logs, all that kinds of stuff. would be necessary in prod though.
